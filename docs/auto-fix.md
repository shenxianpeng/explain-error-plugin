# AI Auto-Fix

> ⚠️ **Experimental.** Auto-fix is opt-in and disabled by default. AI-generated code changes
> can be incorrect, incomplete, or even introduce new bugs. **Always review the pull request
> carefully before merging.**

## What it does

When a build fails and `autoFix: true` is set, the plugin runs this workflow automatically:

1. Sends the error logs to your configured AI provider and asks for a fix suggestion
2. Validates every proposed file path (no path traversal, must match the allow-list)
3. Validates every unified diff before touching any branch
4. Creates a new branch (`fix/jenkins-ai-<build#>-<timestamp>`) via the SCM REST API
5. Applies the diffs and commits all changes atomically
6. Opens a pull request with a structured description (root cause, file changes, build link)
7. Stores the PR URL in the Jenkins build sidebar under **"AI Auto-Fix"**

If any step fails (invalid diff, missing credentials, API error), the branch is deleted and the
build is marked with status `FAILED` — the original build result is not affected.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Jenkins | 2.528.3 or higher |
| Java | 17+ |
| AI provider | Any supported provider configured in global settings (OpenAI, Gemini, Bedrock, Ollama, Custom Okta) |
| SCM | GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab.com, GitLab self-managed, Bitbucket Cloud, or Bitbucket Server / Data Center |
| Token | Personal Access Token (PAT) with **read + write** access to the repository |


---

## Step 1 — Create a PAT and store it in Jenkins

The plugin uses a Jenkins **Secret text** credential or a **Username with password**
credential. For username/password credentials, the password field is used as the SCM token.
SSH keys are not supported for auto-fix API calls.

### GitHub

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> → **Generate new token (classic)**
2. Grant scopes: `repo` (all)
3. Copy the token

For **GitHub Enterprise**, use `https://<your-ghe-host>/settings/tokens`.

### GitLab

1. Go to **User Settings → Access Tokens** (or **Project → Settings → Access Tokens** for a
   project-scoped token)
2. Grant scopes: `api` (or at minimum `read_repository` + `write_repository`)
3. Copy the token

### Bitbucket Cloud

1. Go to **Personal Settings → App passwords**
2. Grant permissions: **Repositories: Read + Write**, **Pull requests: Read + Write**
3. Copy the generated app password (format: `username:apppassword` is **not** what you store —
   store only the app password value; set your Bitbucket username separately if needed)

> Bitbucket Cloud uses `username:apppassword` as the HTTP Basic Auth credential.
> Store only the app-password value in Jenkins; the plugin uses
> the repository owner from the remote URL as the username.

### Add to Jenkins

1. **Manage Jenkins → Credentials → (global) → Add Credentials**
2. Kind: **Secret text** or **Username with password**
3. Secret/password: paste your token
4. ID: choose a memorable ID (e.g. `github-autofix-pat`)

---

## Step 2 — Add `explainError` to your Jenkinsfile

### Minimal example (GitHub)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean verify'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        failure {
            explainError(
                autoFix: true,
                autoFixCredentialsId: 'github-autofix-pat'
            )
        }
    }
}
```

The plugin automatically detects the remote URL from the job's SCM configuration (the same
repository the build checks out from). A PR is opened on that repository.

### With an explicit remote URL (Pipeline jobs)

Pipeline jobs that use `checkout scm` inside a `script` block, or multi-branch pipelines with
complex SCM configs, may not expose the remote URL automatically. Provide it explicitly:

```groovy
explainError(
    autoFix: true,
    autoFixCredentialsId: 'github-autofix-pat',
    autoFixRemoteUrl: 'https://github.com/my-org/my-repo'
)
```

### Self-hosted GitHub Enterprise

```groovy
explainError(
    autoFix: true,
    autoFixCredentialsId: 'ghe-pat',
    autoFixScmType: 'github',
    autoFixGithubEnterpriseUrl: 'https://github.mycompany.com'
)
```

### Self-hosted GitLab

```groovy
explainError(
    autoFix: true,
    autoFixCredentialsId: 'gitlab-pat',
    autoFixScmType: 'gitlab',
    autoFixGitlabUrl: 'https://gitlab.mycompany.com'
)
```

### Bitbucket Cloud

```groovy
explainError(
    autoFix: true,
    autoFixCredentialsId: 'bitbucket-app-password',
    autoFixScmType: 'bitbucket'
)
```

### Bitbucket Server / Data Center

Bitbucket Server uses a completely different REST API (`/rest/api/1.0`) from Bitbucket Cloud.
URL auto-detection works for standard Server clone URLs; use `autoFixScmType: 'bitbucketserver'`
to force it for non-standard hostnames.

**Create a PAT on Bitbucket Server:**

1. Log in → **Account Settings → HTTP access tokens**
2. Click **Create token**
3. Grant permissions: **Repository: Write**, **Pull requests: Write**
4. Copy the generated token

> HTTP access tokens require Bitbucket Server **5.5+** (Data Center 7.x+).
> For older instances, store credentials as `username:password` — the client will use Basic Auth.

**Auto-detection (SSH clone URL):**

Bitbucket Server SSH clone URLs look like `ssh://git@bitbucket.company.com:7999/PROJ/repo.git`.
The plugin detects the port-7999 SSH scheme and configures Server API automatically.

```groovy
explainError(
    autoFix: true,
    autoFixCredentialsId: 'bitbucket-server-pat'
    // autoFixScmType not needed — auto-detected from ssh://.../:7999/... URL
)
```

**Auto-detection (HTTPS clone URL):**

Bitbucket Server HTTPS clone URLs use `/scm/` in the path:
`https://bitbucket.company.com/scm/PROJ/repo.git`.

```groovy
explainError(
    autoFix: true,
    autoFixCredentialsId: 'bitbucket-server-pat'
    // auto-detected from .../scm/... URL
)
```

**Manual override (custom hostname):**

```groovy
explainError(
    autoFix: true,
    autoFixCredentialsId: 'bitbucket-server-pat',
    autoFixScmType: 'bitbucketserver',
    autoFixBitbucketUrl: 'https://bitbucket.company.com'
)
```

> `autoFixBitbucketUrl` is the base URL of your Bitbucket Server instance (no `/rest/api/1.0` suffix —
> the plugin appends it automatically).



## Step 3 — Check the result

After the build completes:

1. Open the build page in Jenkins
2. Click **"AI Auto-Fix"** in the left sidebar
3. If a PR was created, you'll see a button linking directly to it
4. If the fix was skipped or failed, the status message explains why

The PR description includes:
- Root cause summary from the AI
- List of changed files with one-line descriptions
- Build details (job name, build number, fix type, confidence level)

## PR body template

The default PR body looks like this:

```markdown
## AI Auto-Fix for my-job #42

This pull request was automatically generated by the Explain Error Plugin
to address a build failure.

### Root Cause
<AI explanation>

### Changes
- **pom.xml** (modify): Bump jackson-databind from 2.14.0 to 2.15.2

### Build Details
- **Job:** my-folder/my-job
- **Build:** #42
- **Fix Type:** dependency
- **Confidence:** high
```

To customise it, pass a Markdown string with `{placeholder}` tokens:

```groovy
explainError(
    autoFix: true,
    autoFixCredentialsId: 'github-autofix-pat',
    autoFixPrTemplate: '''
## Auto-fix — {jobName} #{buildNumber}

**Root cause:** {explanation}

**Files changed:** {changesSummary}

_Confidence: {confidence} | Type: {fixType}_
'''
)
```

Available placeholders: `{jobName}`, `{buildNumber}`, `{explanation}`, `{changesSummary}`,
`{fixType}`, `{confidence}`.

## What kinds of failures can auto-fix actually handle?

Auto-fix works best for failures where the root cause is **specific and mechanical**:

| Likely to work ✅ | Unlikely to work ❌ |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Outdated/missing dependency version in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | Failing unit tests with logic errors |
| Missing or wrong property in `*.properties` / `*.yml` | Complex refactoring required |
| Wrong Java/Python/Node version in `Dockerfile` or CI config | Environment-specific issues (missing secrets, network) |
| Syntax error in `Jenkinsfile` or `*.yaml` | Flaky tests |
| Missing `package.json` dependency | Multi-file architectural changes |

The AI sets a `confidence` level (`high`, `medium`, `low`). The plugin only proceeds when
confidence is `high` or `medium`. Even then, treat the PR as a **starting point**, not a
guaranteed fix.

---

## Security considerations

- The token is retrieved from Jenkins Credentials at runtime and **never logged**
- The branch name is `fix/jenkins-ai-<build#>-<timestamp>` — no user-controlled input
- File paths are validated against: absolute-path check, path-traversal check (`../`), and the
  allow-list globs — in that order — before any branch is created
- The diff is parsed and validated before it is applied; malformed diffs abort the workflow
- The token has the minimum scope needed: write access to the single repository

The plugin does **not** auto-merge. A human must review and merge the PR.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "autoFixCredentialsId is required for auto-fix"

You set `autoFix: true` but forgot `autoFixCredentialsId`. Add the credentials ID:

```groovy
explainError(autoFix: true, autoFixCredentialsId: 'my-github-pat')
```

### "SCM credentials not found for ID: …"

The credentials ID you provided does not exist in Jenkins, the credential type is not
Secret text or Username with password, or the build does not have permission to access it.
Check **Manage Jenkins → Credentials**.

### "No SCM configured on this job" / "Job type … does not support SCM URL extraction"

The plugin could not determine the remote URL from the job's SCM config. Provide it explicitly:

```groovy
explainError(
    autoFix: true,
    autoFixCredentialsId: 'my-pat',
    autoFixRemoteUrl: 'https://github.com/org/repo'
)
```

### "File path '…' is not allowed by configured path patterns"

The AI suggested modifying a file not in `autoFixAllowedPaths`. Either add the pattern:

```groovy
autoFixAllowedPaths: 'pom.xml,build.gradle,src/main/**/*.java'
```

Or, if the suggestion looks wrong, the AI may have misidentified the root cause — the
explanation step output can help diagnose this.

### "Skipped: AI confidence too low or not fixable"

The AI returned `fixable: false` or `confidence: low`. This is the expected behaviour for
failures that cannot be automatically resolved. Check the explanation for root cause details.

### Auto-fix timed out

Increase `autoFixTimeoutSeconds` (default 120 s). The branch is deleted automatically on
timeout so no orphaned branches are left behind.

### Draft PR not appearing as draft

Draft PRs are only supported on **GitHub** and **GitLab**. Bitbucket Cloud and Bitbucket Server
do not have a native draft PR concept; the PR will be created as a regular open PR regardless of
`autoFixDraftPr: true`.

---

## Known limitations

- **Bitbucket Server multi-file commits**: Unlike Bitbucket Cloud (atomic), Bitbucket Server
  commits each file separately in sequence. This is not atomic, but the fix runs on a dedicated
  branch so partial commits are harmless.
- **Multi-SCM jobs**: only the first configured SCM remote is used for URL extraction.
- **SSH remotes**: SSH URLs (`git@github.com:org/repo.git`) are parsed and converted to HTTPS
  for API calls. The PAT must be a HTTPS token, not an SSH key.
- **AI diff quality**: LLM-generated unified diffs are imperfect. Expect occasional failures
  where the diff context lines don't match the actual file. A fuzzy ±3-line matcher handles
  minor offsets, but large context mismatches still fail cleanly (with rollback).
- **Pipeline SCM detection**: works with `GitSCM` (git plugin) and `CpsScmFlowDefinition`.
  Custom SCM plugins that don't expose `getRepositories()` require `autoFixRemoteUrl`.
